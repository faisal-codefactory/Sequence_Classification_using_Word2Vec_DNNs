# Sequence_Classification_using_Word2Vec_DNNs
This repository demonstrates the usage of word2Vec to learn the Vector embeddings of sequences. These embeddings are loaded in Tensorflow based model, which uses them to perform sequence classification. The results are generated using the Matplotlib, Seaborn.
